I am a student at Marist College and I am 21 years old. I enjoy playing golf,
  music producing, and coding. I am highly interested in entering into the computer science field. Possibly down the road, I'd like to work with artificial intelligence and the new cutting edge technologies around it. I am an intuitive worker and I get along with others very well. I enjoy quality time with friends, family, and my long-haired dachshund, Cody.
