In Blog 3, I will be going over the key takeaways from lesson 3. 

In lesson 3, we learn what frameworks are and how to customize them for your own use.
Wether it is the framework of Bootstrap or utilizing markdown with Jekyll and other sources to produce a professional website, both frameworks are suitable for any programmer. 

We can use these templates and alter the code to our liking. With Jekyll, we can host a local server with the framework code and alter the website how we want to. This is very convenient as most of the layout is already there and you can chose which layout looks best for you.
