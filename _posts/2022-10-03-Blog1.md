# Welcome to Blog 1. 
I will be going over the key takeaways from lesson 1.
In lesson 1, we learn the basics of GitHub and what System Design is all about.
We learn the difference between Git and GitHub. 
We also learn what Git add, Git commit, Git push, Git rm, and Git branch do and how to execute them. 
Utilizing these techniques through the terminal and on the cloud through GitHub.
We use these to create our work from an IDE and upload it to a repository in the cloud.
